                            <p>Always ask your garage what they can do to help before you spend any extra money on hire cars or travel. For example, they might be able to offer you a courtesy car. A court isn’t likely to award you money if the garage offers services that you didn’t take advantage of.</p>

                            <p>It’s a good idea to keep a record and receipts of any extra money you have to pay for travel while you’re disputing a bill. You might need to prove this down the line.</p>

                                    <h3>Your rights and what to say</h3>

                                    <p>If the work wasn’t done with ‘reasonable skill and care’, you have the legal right to get the work done again or get a price reduction. Tell this to the garage. It can be difficult agreeing on what is ‘reasonable’, so it’s a good idea to get a second opinion from another garage.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3>If the garage won’t do the work</h3>

                                <p>You could negotiate with the garage to get a report from an independent garage or vehicle engineer to see if the repairs were done properly. You and the garage would need to agree on who provides this report, how the cost would be split and that you’ll both accept the findings. If the report shows that the work wasn’t done properly then the original garage should fix the car.</p>

                                <p>You could ask another garage to give you a quote or estimate for the work. This will prove that the repairs or service need to be done again, and could help you negotiate with the original garage for the problem to be fixed. Try to get this in writing to support your claim in case you need to take further action.</p>

                                <p>You can ask the garage for a refund of some of the payment you made - you have the legal right to a price reduction if the work wasn’t done with ‘reasonable care and skill’. A second opinion can help you and the garage agree on what is reasonable.</p>

                                <div class="callout--info callout--border">
                                    <p>You may be able to get your money back through your bank. Contact them and say you want to use the ‘chargeback’ scheme. Many bank staff don’t know about the scheme, so you may need to talk to a manager.</p>

                                    <p>If you paid by credit card and the repair cost more than £100, it may be easier to tell your bank you want to ‘make a div 75 claim’.</p>

                                <p>If you agreed on an amount (or got a quote) before the garage did the work, you’ll have to pay the full bill. This is because you’ve entered into a contract with the garage (even if you didn’t sign anything). You can ask for them to come down on the price, but they don’t have to.</p>

                                    <h3>Quote vs estimate</h3>

                                    <p>A quote when a trader has promised to do work at an agreed price - it should say what work will be done and the price.</p>

                                    <p>An estimate is a trader's best guess as to how much the work will cost - it’s not a quote.</p>

                                <p>You can take further action if they’re charging you more than the agreed amount and you think it’s unreasonable.</p>

                                <h3>If you didn’t agree a price before the work was done (or you only got an estimate)</h3>

                                <p>If the trader only gave an estimate then they can charge you more within reason. If you don't think the extra charged is reasonable, ask the garage to come down on the price.</p>

                                    <h3>Your rights and what to say</h3>

                                    <p>If no price was agreed before the work was done, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 gives you the legal right to only pay a ‘reasonable price’. Tell this to the garage.</p>

                                    <p>It can be difficult agreeing on what is ‘reasonable’. It would be reasonable, for example, to be charged more if the garage needed a bit more time for the repairs or they needed more parts. You can get a second opinion from another garage if you’re not sure what is reasonable.</p>

                                <p>If you think the cost is unreasonable and they won’t come down on the price, you should take further action.</p>

                                <p>You can ask the garage for a courtesy car (this is a car that the garage will give you to use - not all garages will offer this). Keep a record of everything extra you spend on travel - you might need to prove this later on.</p>

                                <p>If the car is having body work done and parts are delayed, you could ask to take your car and continue to use it until the parts have arrived.</p>

                                <p>The other actions you should take will depend on whether or not you originally agreed a date for the work to be finished by.</p>

                                <h3>If you agreed on a date for the work to be finished</h3>

                                <p>If you want the original garage to finish the job you should negotiate a new deadline for the repairs to be carried out. If you're not sure what the new deadline should be, you could get the opinion of another garage about how long the repairs should take. Take further action if the garage is not offering to do the work within an acceptable time period.</p>

                                <h3>If you didn’t agree on a date for the work to be finished</h3>

                                <p>Contact the garage and agree on a date for finishing the work - make a note of when you called, who you spoke to and what was agreed.</p>

                                    <h3>Your rights and what to say</h3>

                                    <p>If no date was agreed before the work was done, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 gives you the legal right to get the work done within a ‘reasonable time’. Tell this to the garage.</p>

                                    <p>It can be difficult agreeing on what is ‘reasonable’. It would be reasonable, for example, to be charged more if the garage needed a bit more time for the repairs or they needed more parts. You can get a second opinion from another garage if you’re not sure what is reasonable.</p>

                                <p>Contact the consumer helpline and explain your circumstances. They’ll be able to tell you your legal rights and give you advice on your options.</p>
                                    <h3>Next steps</h3>

                                    <p>Take further action if you can’t agree on a reasonable date to finish the work, or if the work doesn’t get done by the new agreed date.</p>

                            <h2>Take further action if your negotiations have failed</h2>

                            <p>If you’re not getting anywhere with the garage, you have options to help you get the work done or claim compensation. But you should always try to negotiate with the garage first.</p>

                            <p>The garage is not allowed to sell or get rid of the car while you’re disputing the bill. They can, however, keep your car while the bill is being disputed.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>You should consider claiming claiming compensation if you’ve had to spend extra money on transport (eg hire cars or taxis) while disputing a garage bill, or been distressed throughout the process.</p>

                            <h3>Pay the garage so you can get your car back</h3>

                            <p>If you need the car back but aren’t happy with the amount you have to pay, you can pay ‘under protest’ then continue with your dispute. This means you are paying the full amount but letting the garage know that they can expect further action.</p>

                            <p>Write the words “paying under protest” clearly on their copy of the repair order sheet and any copies of receipts that the garage make. If you don’t say you’re paying under protest it will be difficult to get compensation later on, because the garage could argue that by paying the bill, you were accepting the charges.</p>

                            <div class="callout--warning">
                                <p>There’s no guarantee that you’ll get the money back later on, but there are ways to try.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>If you can’t afford to pay, offer to pay what you consider a reasonable amount in exchange for getting the car back, then dispute the rest of the bill separately.</p>

                            <h3>Negotiate through a trade association</h3>

                            <p>Ask the garage if they’re a member of any trade association (eg Motor Codes, the Retail Motor Industry Federation or the Motor Cycle Industry Association). You could also search the trade associations’ websites to see if the garage is a member.</p>

                            <p>Some trade associations will offer a free service where they will help you resolve your dispute with the garage - this can include getting compensation (eg for being out of pocket or having your time wasted).</p>

                            <p>Contact the trade association and explain your circumstances to them - this is sometimes called a ‘conciliation service’.</p>

                            <p>You’ll only be able to get help from a trade association if the garage is a member.</p>

                            <h3>Take the car to another garage</h3>

                            <div class="callout--warning">
                                <p>This is a risky option because you’ll probably need to go to court or a trade association to claim for the extra money you spend to get the work done. There’s no guarantee that you’ll get the money back.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>You might be able to take the car to a different garage. It will depend how much work the original garage has already done and whether or not your car is in a safe condition to drive.</p>

                            <p>If you get the car repaired at a new garage, you can try to claim compensation or go to court for the cost of carrying out extra repairs. You might be able to work with a trade association to get a result (if the garage is a member).</p>

                            <h3>Make a court claim for money you think you’re owed</h3>

                            <p>You can take legal action through the small claims court to get money you think you’re owed. However, this can be costly and time consuming. Depending on how much you’re owed, you might want to get legal advice. You should look at all other options before going to court.</p>

                            <h3>Report the garage to Trading Standards</h3>

                            <p>You can report the garage to Trading Standards. Reporting the garage could mean that other customers don’t get poor service from them in the future.</p>
