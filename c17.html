                        <p>If you’ve had work done at home and there’s a problem caused by the trader, you should be able to get it fixed - or get at least some of your money back.</p>

                        <p>Whatever the problem is, you’ll need to talk to the trader and come to an agreement.</p>

                        <p>You should take up the problem with the trader who arranged the work, even if they ‘sub-contracted’ (passed on) all or some of it to another business.</p>

                        <p>Before you do that, it’s a good idea to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>gather any paperwork and receipts</li>
                                <li>take photos to use as evidence of the problem</li>
                                <li>make notes about what’s happened, including dates and times</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>What you should do next depends on the type of problem.</p>

                                <p>The trader should have done the work with ‘reasonable care and skill’. This means they should have done a good job that’s worth the amount they’re charging you. If they haven’t done this, they’ve broken the law.</p>

                                <p>You should ask them to fix the problem or do the work again. They’ll have to cover all the costs, including extra materials.</p>

                                <h3>What to do</h3>
                                <p>Let them know you understand what you’re entitled to. What you should say is slightly different depending on when you gave the go-ahead for the work.</p>

                                <p>The trader should fix the problem within a reasonable amount of time, without causing you too much inconvenience. The law doesn’t say what counts as reasonable, so you’ll have to agree it between you.</p>
                                <p>If they can’t or won’t fix the problem, you can ask for a partial or full refund - depending on how bad the problem is. You’ll have to come to an agreement with them about how much you should get. It’s a good idea to start by suggesting a figure and explaining why you think it’s reasonable, then take it from there.</p>
                                <p>Once you’ve agreed on the amount, the law says you should get your refund within 14 days.</p>

                                    <p>A quote (sometimes called a ‘quotation’ or 'fixed estimate') is a promise to do work at an agreed price. An estimate is the trader's best guess as to how much the work will cost.</p>

                                        <li>they let you know they’d need to do extra work, and you agreed to pay more because of it</li>

                            <p>If they can’t give you a good reason for raising the price, tell them that you’ll only pay what was quoted. It’s a good idea to put this in writing so you have a record.</p>

                                    <li>Check if the trader’s a member of a trade association. Look on the trader’s website or ask them if you can’t find this information. Contact the trade association and explain the situation.</li>
                                    <li>Ask the trader if they’re a member of an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme - it’s a way of solving disagreements without going to court. If they don’t respond or won’t use an ADR scheme, keep a record of the fact that you asked them (and the date).</li>
                                    <li>Choose a <a href="http://www.tradingstandards.uk/advice/ADRApprovedBodies.cfm">Trading Standards-approved ADR scheme</a> yourself to try to solve the problem more informally. It’ll help you later if you end up going to court.</li>
                                    <li>Claim compensation if you have to get someone else to do or re-do the work. This could mean simply asking the trader for compensation or it could involve taking them to court, which could be costly and time consuming.</li>
