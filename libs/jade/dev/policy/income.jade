                    p The recent introduction of the national living wage and #[a(href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/current-rates-and-allowances") tax-free personal allowance] are aimed at increasing income for working households.

                    p New evidence from Citizens Advice reveals the security of that income – and of people’s employment in general – has been an overlooked piece of the labour market puzzle.

                    p The numbers of people in insecure work have remained fairly constant since 2011 and have not fallen back to pre-recession levels. So despite record employment rates, the persistence of insecure work leaves many households at continued risk of economic shocks, and unable to plan for the future.
                    
                    h3 What factors matter to workers?
                    p We asked respondents about the factors that mattered most when looking for a job. Much recent policy debate has focused on levels of pay and wage floors, people said a steady income is as important as the amount of money they earn. Income security was seen as more important than the job’s location, or its opportunities for advancement.
