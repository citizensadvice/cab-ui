			p Thank you for completing the tool. You’ll start to see a difference in the amount of junk mail you receive within the next 4 weeks.

			p Put a ‘no junk mail’ sign on your door or letterbox to help stop junk mail that's delivered door-to-door - for example takeaway menus

			p You can make a sign yourself - write “No commercial leaflets”. You also can order stickers online from the #[a.a-external(href="#") Stop Junk Mail Campaign].
