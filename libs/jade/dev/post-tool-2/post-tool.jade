			p Use this tool to easily contact the 4 organisations that will help to reduce the amount of junk mail you get through the post.

			p There's no single organisation you can register with, it's best to contact them all.

			p This tool will either send an email, or give you a letter to send to each organisation to let them know you don't want junk mail.

			.callout--alert
				p Put a ‘no junk mail’ sign on your door or letterbox to help stop junk mail that's delivered door-to-door - for example takeaway menus

				p You can make a sign yourself - write “No commercial leaflets”. You also can order stickers online from the #[a.a-external(href="#") Stop Junk Mail Campaign].

			p You'll still get post addressed to 'the occupier', and from organisations that you've communicated with before.
