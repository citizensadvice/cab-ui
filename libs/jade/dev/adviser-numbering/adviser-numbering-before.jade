			p Use our Personal Independence Payment (PIP) guidance to help you fill in your PIP claim form. There is advice for each question, including: 

			ul
				li what the questions mean
				li what to write about in your answers
				li examples of answers people might give
				li help explaining how your illness or disability affects you

			p PIP is based on how your condition affects you. It's not based on your particular illness or disability, or your medication.

			p Itâ€™s very important to think about each question. Our help pages will help you to decide if you need to answer each question.
