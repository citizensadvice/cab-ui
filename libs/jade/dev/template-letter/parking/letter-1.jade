		p You can use this letter to challenge an unfair ticket you were given when parked on private land – for example at a supermarket or hospital car park. This could be because you didn't break the car park's rules, the rules weren't clear, or the parking charge is higher than £100.

		p It’s important to include as much evidence as you can. For example, a photo of your car parked according to the rules or a copy of your ticket.

		p This template is to be used for guidance and may not suit your specific situation. If you need more help, contact your #[a(href="template-letter-list.html") nearest Citizens Advice].

					| Dear Sir or Madam,
					p
					| Complaint about faulty goods
					p
					| I bought a sewing machine from you on 25 October 2015. I paid £229.99.
					p
					| I now find the goods have the following fault:
					p
					| The machine stops working after half an hour and won't work again for at least an hour.
					p
					| Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 goods you supply must be fit for purpose. As there was a problem with the goods when I bought them, I request that you give me a full refund.
					p
					| I have enclosed a copy of the receipt in support of my claim.
					p
					| Please respond within 14 days of receiving this letter.
					p
					| Yours faithfully
