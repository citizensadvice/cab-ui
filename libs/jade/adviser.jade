					| This page outlines the #[strong current] eligibility for Universal Credit, also known as the ‘gateway conditions’.
				p Eventually, clients in different circumstances will also be able to claim Universal Credit, but at the moment there are restrictions on who can claim while it’s being rolled out.
				p This page will be updated regularly as the eligibility rules change.
			p Universal Credit is a new benefit that you can only get in some parts of the UK.
			p If you’re living in a Universal Credit area, you might need to apply for Universal Credit instead of other existing benefits like Jobseeker's Allowance, Housing Benefit or Tax Credits etc.
			p It’s mainly available to people who are unemployed or earn less than £338 a month - but you can get it in some other circumstances.

			p It can be complicated to work out if you’re eligible just by reading all the small print - the rules are outlined in full below.
			p It might be quicker and easier to talk to an expert so you can explain your personal circumstances. You can do this in a few ways:
			ul
				li call the #[strong Universal Credit helpline] on 0345 600 0723 (Textphone: 0345 600 0743). Calls can cost 9p a minute from a landline, or between 8p and 40p a minute from a mobile (your phone supplier can tell you how much you’ll pay). You can call and ask them to call you back
				li contact your #[a(href="/about-us/how-we-provide-advice/advice/search-for-your-local-citizens-advice/") local Citizens Advice]

			p The first thing you should do is see if you live in a Universal Credit area. Follow these steps:
			ol
				li #[a.a-external(href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=1&amp;lang=en", rel="external", target="_blank") Find your nearest Jobcentre] if you don’t know it.
				li Check the list of #[a.a-external(href="https://www.gov.uk/jobcentres-where-you-can-claim-universal-credit", rel="external", target="_blank") Jobcentres that accept Universal Credit applications] to find out if your nearest Jobcentre is on the list. Some Jobcentres are only accepting claims from single people - the list will say where.
			p If you can’t apply for Universal Credit, you should look at other benefits - use the Turn2us benefits checker to #[a.a-external(href="http://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou", rel="external", target="_top") see what you can apply for]. Your #[a(href="/about-us/how-we-provide-advice/advice/search-for-your-local-citizens-advice/") local Citizens Advice] can also help you.

			p To be eligible for Universal Credit, you must currently:
			ul
				li expect to earn less than £338 (after tax) in the next month
				li be between 18 years old and 60 years and 6 months old
				li be a British citizen (non-British citizens can #[a(href="/benefits/universal-credit/before-you-apply/eligibility-non-british-citizen/", target="_top") apply in some places])
				
				li have a National Insurance number
				li have less than £6,000 in savings or other investments - eg shares, or property that you don't live in. This is increased to a £16,000 limit if you live in certain areas of Sutton or Croydon - see below
			p If you live with your partner, you usually both need to be eligible. You'll need to:
			ul
				li live at the same address (you don't have to be married or civil partners to apply)
				li expect to earn less than £541 (after tax) combined in the next month
				li have less than £6,000 in savings or other investments between you. This is increased to a £16,000 limit if you live in certain areas of Sutton or Croydon - see below
			p There are currently very limited circumstances when you can apply as a single person while being part of a couple who is living together. You can read more in #[a(href="/benefits/universal-credit/before-you-apply/how-universal-credit-works-for-couples/") the rules for how Universal Credit works for couples].

				p There are fewer restrictions on applying if you live in parts of Sutton and Croydon. If you have a postcode beginning with SM5 2**, SM6 7**, SM6 8**, SM6 9** or CR0 4**,  this section does not apply to you.

			p You must have lived in the UK for the last 2 years, and not have been abroad for more than 4 weeks continuously during that time.

			ul
				li you can't work or look for work (eg because of illness or disability)
				li you’re in supported or temporary accommodation
				li you’re a homeowner
				li you’ve applied for a fitness for work note from a doctor
