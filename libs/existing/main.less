    Development notes
    -----------------

    Before starting to edit this make the following changes to your CSS editing preferences
    In Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> CSS -> Formatting, set the option to "Semi-expanded".
    In Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> CSS -> Tabs, set indenting to "Smart"

    Read https://citizensadvice.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/Coding+Standard+-+CSS
    Obviously we are using LESS, but the syntax is fairly similar and the same rules apply.

    Use the full power of LESS http://lesscss.org/features/

    We are aiming for the site to contain one single stylesheet and no separate print stylesheet
    or IE specific stylesheets

    Make sure you comment anything that is slightly unusual.

    Study bootstrap, HTML5 boilerplate and CSS reset for hints and tips

    Do not use id selectors (eg #id)
    Do not use !important EVER
    Use BEM like naming.  Avoid using abbreviations in names.

    Don't keep throwing styles at something till it looks like it works.  Only
    add exactly what you need and understand why you have added each style.

    Separate code into self contained modules using a separate file for each module.

    Keep your selectors simple.  The best selector is a single class selector.

    Favour using mixins rather than muliple repeated classes in the HTML.  For example
    BAD: <p class="red cursive big">
    BETTER: <p class="highlight--fancy">

    Use ems or % rather than px for sizes.
    Never use a unit for line-height.  Use relative sizes and remember line-height is inherited.

    Use global variables for all magic values, for example colours and break-points.

    To target IE6 use the _ hack e.g, p { _color: red; } will only work in IE6 and will be ignored by all other browsers
    To target IE7 use the * hack e.g, p { *color: red; } will only work in IE6 and 7 and will be ignored by all other browsers
    To target IE8 use the .ie8 class.  There is no CSS hack that can reliably target IE8
    Do not try to target any other browser.

    Classes starting with js- are to be used as JavaScript hooks.  Do not use these as style hooks.

    Remember that font-family, font-size and line-height is inherited.
    It only needs to be declared once on the body element.

    If including an SVG as a data uri, do not use base64 encoding.  It isn't binary data and will make it
    1.5 times larger than it needs to be.
